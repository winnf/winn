### The Project
Thermo is designed to improve thermoregulation of Paralympians with spinal cord injury (SCI), who rely on wheelchairs. It aims to reduce the risk of hyperthermia and hypothermia, as well as improving the quality of training and athletic performance during competition. The device measures the athleteâ€™s body temperature during physical activity non-invasively. If the body temperature outside of a normal body temperature range, the device warns the user and automatically activates a negative feedback mechanism to return the body temperature to the accepted levels.
