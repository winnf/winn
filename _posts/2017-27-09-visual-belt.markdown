The [Visual Belt](https://github.com/winnf/visualBelt) is a device that helps the visually impaired by providing sound alerts when incoming objects are detected. The goal of the project is to reduce risk of collision, encourage independence, and provide a method for individuals to safety navigate their surroundings. It was built using multiple ultrasonic sensors, speakers, and an Arduino, integrated into a belt. Currently, it detects incoming objects from various directions and plays a sound for each direction (i.e. left, right, behind, front). The closer the object, the more frequent the sound alerts.
